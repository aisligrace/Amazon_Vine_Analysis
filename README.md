# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Module 16
## Overview
The purpose of this assignment was to select a data file containing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Vine program and perform an analysis. We used PySpark, AWS RDS, PG Admin and SQL to complete the analysis. I selected the 'Pet Products' file. After we extracted and transformed the data, we then looked deeper into whether or not the paid reviews had any bias compared to nonpaid reviews.
